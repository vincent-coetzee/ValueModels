// WARNING
//
// This class is purely intended as a demonstration of how to use
// ValueModels to write a custom control. It's a crappy implementation
// of a rudimentary color picker control for iOS. The SelectionInList that
// it models can be fed straight into other widgets that understand how to
// consume ValueModels. Please don't judge my iOS skills based on this class
// since it is ugly and crude.
